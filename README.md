# hello-world
I'm learning how to use github. 

My name is Cassiday. I'm learning coding, data science, and computer science foundational things for fun. 

What I achieved with the Github Guide "Hello World" 

1. Created an open source repository

2. Started and managed a new branch

3. Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub

4. Opened and merged a Pull Request
